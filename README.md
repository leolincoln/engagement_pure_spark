# steps
    [ ] 500 main cluster
    [ ] take all cluster > 200 and recluster into 10 sub clusters. E.g. if you have 50 in 500 main cluster that has size > 200, then you will have 450 + 50*10 clusters in the end
    [ ] Create plot for final result. Centroid distance + max + max and centroid distance - max - max
    [ ]  Count1: values on the left larger than 0.000001
    [ ] Count2: count of values on the right smaller than 1.34
    [ ] Count3: count of values on the left larger than 1.48

#measures
    [ ] Max point to center
    [ ] Average point to center
    [ ] cluster sizes
    [ ] cluster centroids
